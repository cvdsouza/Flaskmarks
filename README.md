Flask Bookmarks
===============

My simple and self educational Flask + sqlalchemy based bookmark app

Install
=======

Activate the virtualenv (ex: `. venv/bin/activate`)

run `sh deploy.sh`

make a copy of config.py.example to config.py and edit accordingly, then run `python run.py`

Credits

This app is heavily inspired by the flaks sqlalchemy tutorial @ http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world
